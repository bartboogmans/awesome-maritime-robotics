## Data
- [REMARO data](https://github.com/remaro-network/remaro_data)

## Control effort generation - Control effort allocation:
- [MVP-Control](https://github.com/uri-ocean-robotics/mvp_control): A generic vehicle low-level vehicle controller (implements a control allocation algorithm with quadratic programming).

## Planning/Guidance mission-planning:
- [MVP-Mission](https://github.com/uri-ocean-robotics/mvp_mission): A generic behavior-based state-oriented mission planner. It contains common behaviors for marine guidance.
